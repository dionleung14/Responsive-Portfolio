### Features of index.html
The index.html file serves as the main page of the portfolio. It contains the About Me section with space for an image and caption. Like all the webpages in this portfolio, it features a dynamic and responsive nav bar, a non-distracting background image, and a muted color scheme that focuses on the content.

### Features of portfolio.html
The portfolio.html file serves as a placeholder page for projects to be completed later. Like all the webpages in this portfolio, it features a dynamic and responsive nav bar, a non-distracting background image, and a muted color scheme that focuses on the content.

### Features of contact.html
The contact.html file serves as a page that visitors can submit their contact information to me. Like all the webpages in this portfolio, it features a dynamic and responsive nav bar, a non-distracting background image, and a muted color scheme that focuses on the content.

### Specific stylings made to style.css
Several key overrides to Bootstrap classes were made in the style.css file. Namely, getting the breakpoints for mobile and responsive viewing to be at the 980px, 768px, and 640px marks instead of the Bootstrap defaults of 1200px, 992px, 768px, and 576px.

### Additional comments and notes
The creation of this website was made possible by using Bootstrap CSS Framework. 

> Collaborated in part with Louis, Yared, Marissa, and Michael.
